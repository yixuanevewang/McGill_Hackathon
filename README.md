McGill 2021 Hackathon

-first 1000 simulation: contact person = 19 (ie. ~2% of particles made it 2m) /n
-simulated 1000 times again, but set abs(z) < 150 (to account for average height of person), resulted in 87 hits (ie. 8.7%) /n
-set abs(x) and abs(y) < 1 (ie. 1 metre distance) and abs(z) <150, 519 hits out of 1000 (52% chance of being infected with non-top talking)
