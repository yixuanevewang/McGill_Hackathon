# hackathon
McGill 2021 Physics Hackathon
 - first ever hack
 - simulated the random walk of 1000 airborned viral molecules to test the effectiveness of 2m social distancing
 - worked on project with Jessica

## files
airborne_virus - the latest version of the code to run the simulation. currently set at 2m distancing.

2m_distancing_plot.png - layered line plot of 1000 sims with 2m distancing

2m_distancing_scatter.png - scatter plot of the final positions of the airborne viruses with 2m distancing. See a gradient with highest concentration near the centre

probability_2m.png - output of the graph along with the number of molecules in contact with a person, as well as the probability that the person if infected with covid while distancing 2m

probability_1m.png - output of graph with console for distancing of 1m
